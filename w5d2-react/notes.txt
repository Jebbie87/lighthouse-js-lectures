React Component Lifecycle Events
=================================

Components go through various states (not-mounted-to-DOM, mounting, mounted, updating)
React allows you to set functions that will be called during each stage

Mount vs. Update

  mount: when a component goes from not-existing to existing-in-the-DOM for the first time
  update: when an already-mounted-component updates (b/c of changes to props or its state)

  ex. a parent component can use an if statement to sometimes include a child component
      this would mount and unmount the component


Most of your components should be "dumb" (ie. only have a render() method)


Common Uses of Lifecycle events:

   1. Triggering custom state events when a component is mounted (ex. fetch some data via Ajax)
   2. Deal w/ External Library Code (ex. Google Maps)




Handling User Events
====================

  add handlers directly to the JSX dom element
    <div onClick={(e) => {   }}>

  DEMO: input elements





Different Strategies for Organizing App State w/ React
======================================================

  1. Local State in Each Component
     (using this.setState, and passing state-modifying functions down)

    <APP>
      initialState(): {currentRoom: ""}
      changeRoom(x): fn that updates this.state.currentRoom (can be passed to child components via props)
      render():

      <ROOM-LIST>
        initialState(): {rooms: []}
        mount(): make an ajax request to get rooms, then update this.state.rooms
        render():
          loop through this.state.rooms:
          <ROOM-NAME>
            onClick(): call changeRoom(id-of-room) (received from <APP> via props)

      <CHATROOM>
        onUpdate(): make an ajax request to get message, then update this.state.messages
        render():
          loop through this.state.messages:
          <MESSAGE>



  2. Single Global State in the App Component
     (using this.setState, and passing state-modifying functions down)



  3. Single Global State in an External Object
     (global functions to modify state (which make sure to call React.render() ) and read subsets of state)

      window.state = {
        currentRoom: null,
        messages: [],
        rooms: []
      }
      state.setState = function(k,v) {
        state[k] = v;
        render();
      }
      state.setRoom = function(roomId) {
        setState("currentRoom", roomId);
      }
      state.setRooms = functions(rooms) {
        setState("rooms", rooms);
      }
      state.setMessages = functions(messages) {
        setState("messages", messages);
      }
      state.fetchRooms = function() {
        ajax(...).then(function(resp) {
          this.setRooms(resp);
        });
      }
      state.fetchMessages = function() {
        ajax(...).then(function(resp) {
          this.setMessages(resp);
        });
      }

    <APP>
      render():
      <ROOM-LIST>
        render():
          loop through state.rooms:
          <ROOM-NAME>
            onClick(): call state.setRoom(id-of-room)

      <CHATROOM>
        render():
          loop through state.messages:
          <MESSAGE>



  4. Mix of the above (NOT recommended)
